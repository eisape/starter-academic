I am a second-year PhD student at MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences where I investigate the way the brain represents the world via cognitive modeling. Specifically, I use language as a window into the mind and language models as candidate models of human language processing. Prior to MIT I completed a B.S in  Computer Science at Boston College under the supervision of   Joshua Hartshorne and Stefano Anzellotti.
